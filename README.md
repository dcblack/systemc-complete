SystemC Complete
================

About this directory
--------------------

This is the source code for the Systemc-Complete scripts and docker files.

WARNING: This is a project under development and not quite ready for full deployment.

Tested platforms
----------------

This has been tested on the following platforms:

+ Mac OS X 10.15.6 (Catalina)

Please send feedback so we can know your success and add to this list, we will credit you.

How to build
------------

There are a number of dependencies if you want to use this project. Below is a simple list including the currently used versions of those tools. This may work with earlier versions, but no testing has been done. If you use an older version and it works, please let us know. If you have problems with a newer version please let us know.

| Tool     | Version | Website                                        |
| :------- | :------ | :--------------------------------------------- |
| `make`   | 4.3     | https://www.gnu.org/software/make/             |
| `docker` | 19.03.8 | https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop |
| `git`    | 2.26.2  | https://git-scm.com/                           |
| `perl`   | 5.26.3  | https://www.perl.org/                          |
| `bash`   | 5.0.17  | https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/             |

Note: On Mac OS X, we used MacPorts to obtain some of the above. You will likely find that Ubuntu's apt-get will get decent versions. Please let us know your experiences so that we can add to this list.

Once the tools are in place, you should be able to build this with a simple command:

```bash
git checkout works #< unless you want to use the latest (possibly broken) version
make image
```

You should also check out the documentation associated with the `makefile` with the command:

```bash
make help
```

How to use
----------

Once you have built the docker image you can of course use the docker commands to run it; however, you might find a convenience script of interest. Simply add the local `bin/` directory to your PATH and use either of the following syntax's:

```bash
  scc # with no arguments simply puts you into the Ubuntu container
  scc COMMAND # see below
```

You can simply source `setup.profile` to add the syntax if you are using an `sh` style shell (i.e., sh, bash, zsh, ksh).

The above will ensure the directory you are in at the time of invocation is attached to the container. This allows you to develop your code in a local directory and simply use the `scc` (systemc-complete) tool to compile and execute. See [Examples](#ex) below.

Commands beyond obvious `bash` that you can use include:

* `build` `make` `ninja` `g++` `clang++` `astyle` `cppcheck` `new` `rsync` `git` `less` `vim` (non-GUI)

We intentionally did not include GUI tools to keep the image and its complexity relatively small.

Examples
--------

### Setup project directory

```bash
mkdir ~/trivial && cd ~/trivial

### Trivial source

Create the following three files.

â€‹```c++
//FILE: trivial.hpp
#ifndef TRIVIAL_HPP
#define TRIVIAL_HPP
#include <systemc>
struct Trivial_module : sc_core::sc_module
{
  Trivial_module( sc_core::sc_module_name instance );
  ~Trivial_module( void ) = default;
private:
  void main_thread( void );
};
#endif
```

```c++
//FILE: trivial.cpp
#include "trivial.hpp"

using namespace sc_core;

Trivial_module::Trivial_module( sc_core::sc_module_name instance )
: sc_module( instance )
{
  SC_REPORT_INFO( "/Doulos/trivial", "Constructing Trivial_module" );
  SC_HAS_PROCESS( Trivial_module );
  SC_THREAD( main_thread );
}

void Trivial_module::main_thread( void )
{
  SC_REPORT_INFO( "/Doulos/trivial", "Starting main_thread" );
  wait( 10, SC_NS );
  SC_REPORT_WARNING( "/Doulos/trivial", "Stopping main_thread" );
  sc_stop();
}
```

```c++
//FILE: main.cpp
#include "trivial.hpp"
#include <systemc>

using namespace sc_core;

int sc_main( int argc, char* argv[] )
{
  SC_REPORT_INFO( "/Doulos/trivial", "Constructing top" );
  Trivial_module top{"top"};
  SC_REPORT_INFO( "/Doulos/trivial", "Initiating simulation" );
  sc_start();
  SC_REPORT_INFO( "/Doulos/trivial", "Exiting" );
  return 0;
}
```

### SystemC sources in a single directory

Run as follows...

```bash
scc compile
```

### SystemC sources described by Makefile

Create the following file:

```make
#!make -f
#FILE: Makefile

UNIT:=trivial
SRCS:=main.cpp trivial.cpp
CXX:=clang++

include /apps/make/Makefile.rules
```
Run as follows...

```bash
scc make clean run
```

### SystemC compiled via Cmake

Create the following file:

```cmake
#!cmake .
#FILE: CMakeLists.txt
# This works with SystemV versions 2.3.2 and later, which have support for
# cmake and specify SystemC_CXX_STANDARD.
# 
# REQUIREMENTS:
#   Define SYSTEMC_HOME to point to install directory of SystemC (not source) -- /apps/systemc
#   Option: CCI_HOME -- /apps/cci

cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.11)
set(TARGET_EXECUTABLE $<TARGET_FILE_NAME:trivial.exe>)
project(trivial CXX)

include( /apps/cmake/BuildTypes.cmake )
include( /apps/cmake/SystemC.cmake )
include( /apps/cmake/strict.cmake )

add_compile_definitions(SC_INCLUDE_FX SC_INCLUDE_DYNAMIC_PROCESSES)

add_executable(trivial.exe
  trivial.cpp
  main.cpp
)
```

Run as follows...

```bash
mkdir -p build
scc build -run
```
